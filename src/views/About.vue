          <p class="left">
            And i am currently getting my Bachelors' in Media Informatics and Visual
            Computing at TU Wien. Additionally, i am working with the University of Salzburg on building out a platform for
            students and citizens to study trees and their effects on the climate.

      <p>
        <b>Usability.</b>
        <span class="text-subtle">
          Working as a software developer, I realized this might be what really interests me. It's also the reason
          i study this specific bachelors' programme. Usability has become my favourite topic over the last two years.
          Meaningfully improving applications, thinking about their users' context and testing them is of great appeal
          to me. If an application is especially pleasant to use, I am super ecstatic about it for days.
          Hopefully you find this website fine too ðŸ˜„!

        <b>Side Projects.</b>
        <span class="text-subtle">
          These are mostly programming-related things like a Raspberry-based temperature
          display/logger for my room, this website and more. Recently I've played with the idea of creating my own
          board-gaming-computer to make keeping track of score easier, maybe even with Spotify integration. These things
          take time, since I do not like half-assed stuff and don't have that much free-time in between uni and work.

      <p>
        <b>Breaking Bad.</b>
        <span class="text-subtle">
          It's the best series ever! The amount of times I have watched this superb series is beyond sane. Although
          this has kinda become a running gag among some of my friends, I don't regret it at all.

      <p>
        <b>Hiking.</b>
        <span class="text-subtle">
          My go-to way to wind down, especially after months of being in a big city. I try to go hiking almost
          every day in the summer when I'm in Salzburg.

      <p>
        <b>Public Transport.</b>
        <span class="text-subtle">
          Always have been and always will be. One day I'll make that public transportation game I have
          planned for years.
