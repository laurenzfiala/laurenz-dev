      <h2>University of Salzburg</h2>
      <p>
        Since December of 2017 I've been working on a site called Â»Urban Trees as climate messengersÂ«, which aimed to
        gather data on trees in cities and how they affect the climate around them. For that, a web-app and an Android
        app were implemented and maintained. It allowed the participating students to enter data on the current state
        of a trees' phenology (how open the buds are) and automatically read out data from trees with Bleutooth beacons.
      </p>

        Starting in June 2020, a new project has been granted by the <a href="https://www.ffg.at/">Austrian Research
        Promotion Agency</a>
        with a similar focus on education, but this time with a broader scope. Three university-departments are
        cooperating with schools around Autria.<br/>
        In the coming months, the old website will steadily be transformed to fit the new project and I will build new
        CMS-like tools for students to easily customize their own Trees' webpage with data, charts and text.

      <p>
        This is a small website I made in the summer of 2019 for an old friend of mine. I only used standard web
        technologies and jQuery. For some backend logic I wrote a few PHP-scripts again, which I had not done in years.
        It's not as bad as I remember, at least for <i>very</i> simple logic. Anyway, the site turned out pretty nicely
        and shows off the great artwork prominently ðŸ™‚.
