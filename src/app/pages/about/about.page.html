  <app-heading text="Hi ðŸ‘‹"></app-heading>

  <p>
    I'm Laurenz, a software engineer and usability-aficionado. This space is intended as a place
    where I can show my current and past creations and document the process too.
  </p>
  <p>
    I also aim to regularly post over on the <a routerLink="/posts" class="link">posts</a> page once
    it's finished, so I have a reference for future work. All while improving my skills in
    hyper-iterative development.
    <small>
      Psst, I also hope this gives me the motivation to more regularly work on my personal projects.

    What I do in my free time you ask? Well, I like to go hiking with friends, talk about the most
    useless technical details and going on Interrail trips with my partner.

    Feel free to send me a message via e-mail or telegram! I am glad to hear any web-related or
    technical news. Corrections and discussions are also welcome. ðŸ˜„ If you're looking to hire, I am
    also happy to consider your request. I am, however, not looking for advertisers or other
    commerical communications.

        I will delete all data as soon as the correspondence is concluded, (maximum of 30 days after
        the last message) or you request it. Note that I might keep anonymized copies of the
        communications for longer. My e-mail provider deletes any metadata logs after 14 days.
